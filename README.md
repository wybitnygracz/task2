# memory game

The task:
You are asked to create a mind memory game using React or any component based library / framework of choice. An example of this can be found here.

Generate a board containing random pairs of cards.
To begin all the cards are face down. When clicked they will unveil either a number, image, or color (you choose).
When 2 cards are successfully matched they will remain shown until the game is over.
If 2 cards are not matched successfully the content will be hidden once again.
When all cards are matched successfully a message is displayed to the user telling them they have won and after the board is reset.
